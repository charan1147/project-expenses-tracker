 Project Description

The Expense Tracker Application is a full-stack web application designed to help users track, manage, and analyze their expenses** efficiently.

The backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, and provides secure REST APIs for:
- User authentication
- Personal expense management
- Group expense handling
- Expense splitting among multiple users

Authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure that only authorized users can access protected resources.

This backend serves as the core system that:
- Stores user data securely
- Handles business logic
- Validates requests
- Manages relationships between users, expenses, and groups
